# Generics-Dart

Generics is a way to create a class, or function that can work with different types of data (objects).
If you look at the internal implementation of List class, it is a generic class.
It can work with different data types like int, String, double, etc.
For example, List<int> is a list of integers, List<String> is a list of strings, and List<double> is a list of double values.
