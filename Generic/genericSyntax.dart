/*
Generics is a way to create a class,
 or function that can work with different types of data (objects). 
If you look at the internal implementation of List class, it is a generic class. 
It can work with different data types like int, String, double, etc. 
For example, List<int> is a list of integers, 
List<String> is a list of strings, and List<double> is a list of double values.

/*
Syntax
class ClassName<T> {

/*
Generics Type Variable
Generics type variables are used to define the type of data that can be used with the class. 
In the above example, T is a type variable. 
You can use any name for the type variable. 
A few typical names are T, E, K, and V.

Name	Work
T	- Type
E -	Element
K	- Key
V	- Value
